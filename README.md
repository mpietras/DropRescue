# DropRescue

Playing around with a JavaScript sprite/animation library PixiJS by putting together a simple game.  I remember in the 1980's playing a game called Meteor Mission 2 on TRS-80 so my thoughts were centered around how that functioned.  After grabbing some resources from places like [asteroids](https://opengameart.org/content/asteroid-sprite-sheets) and [ship](https://arcadeisland.itch.io/space-shooter-wang-tiles) and [explosion](https://tokka.itch.io/pixel-explosion-basic-set) and putting together a stage and some motion I realized PixiJS does not have any kind of collision logic so I need to look into a proper game engine like maybe Phaser.  I initially tried to shim in some logic provided by [SAT.js](https://github.com/jriecken/sat-js) for collision detection but it turns out `SAT.js` doesn't support concave polygons.  I found some code at https://codepen.io/osublake/pen/eMvZmo which seemed to handle edge collisions but it was on an older version of PIXI so I integrated what I needed and upgraded that logic, and added logic to detect objects being completely inside of other objects (as opposed to just edge collisions).  Getting the paths around the asteroids was a pain - I couldn't find a tool that found control points around sprite images so I just ended up using Gimp to create a path around each one then exporting the paths and using `path.py` to convert it into the control points I needed.

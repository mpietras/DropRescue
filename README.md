Playing around with a JavaScript sprite/animation library PixiJS by putting together a simple game.  I remember in the 1980's playing a game called Metor Mission 2 on TRS-80 so my thoughts were centered around how that functioned.  After grabbing some resources from places like https://opengameart.org/ and putting together a stage and some motion I realized PixiJS does not have any kind of collision logic so I need to look into a proper game engine like maybe Phaser.  I might also be able to shim in some specific logic like SAT.js and essentially roll my own engine.
